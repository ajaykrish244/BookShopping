### Race condition
* Race condition is implemented
* To test race condition, open regular browser and login as a user, and open another browser in incognito and login as another user
* Purchase the same product, make sure that one of them tries to buy all books and the other tries to buy some
* Fill out the purchase forms for both users on both browser
* Submit the filled-out purchase form for user who us trying to buy all the books and wait for transaction to go through
* Then try to submit the filled-out purchase form by the other user.  You'll see that the other user will get a notification indicating that the book they are trying to buy is out of stock

### Form Pre-filling
* When the user has entered their address, credit card number, phone number during sign up or have updated their profile with the details. During the transaction, the details gets prefilled.

### Design choices
* When a book is deleted, all reviews and transactions related to that book will also be deleted
* Admin is allowed to buy books
* Users (including admin) can only see their own purchase history
* Reviews for a book are shown through that book's page, instead of having all reviews for all books by all users clumps into one page.  __This full-fill the requirement to filter reviews by book by default__
* Reviews written by a user are show through the person's user profile
* The filter function for reviews using user name is for each book 
* The checks to make sure a user (non-admin) cannot edit other's user profile by changing the URL is implemented.  For example,
  * current logged in user has id 1
  * they try to access http://152.7.177.6:3000/users/2/edit to try to edit user with id 2 profile
  * though the URL doesn't correct itself, the information on the edit page is still of user with id 1, 
  * and even if they submit the changes, the changes would be applied to the profile of user with id 1
  * profile of user with id 2 is untouched in this case
  * you can check this using admin login and views
